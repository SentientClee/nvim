## Notes

A list of things I want to do better in Neovim and so should configure.

- README.md preview ability
- Better text object mappings for tree sitter for improved movement
- Auto pairs for closing (), {}, []. Likely requires integration with tree sitter.
- Better keymaps for Gitsigns and git work
